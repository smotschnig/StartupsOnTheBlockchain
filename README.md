# StartupOnTheChain
a blockchain-based startup webplatform

#### How to get started?

* Clone Repository: `https://github.com/smotschnig/StartupOnTheChain.git`
* Open folder `StartupOnTheChain`
* Run `npm install`
* Start Server by `node server.js`

After that you can visit the Webapp with your Browser at `http://localhost:3000` or you may change the Port in the `server.js` File.
You have to install Metamask connected with a Rinkeby-Account to use the Webapp correctly. 

If there are problems with npm install on Windows, you have to install Dependencies globally.
* Run `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`
* Run `npm install --global node-gyp`
